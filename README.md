### Background

These programs were written when I was learning the SSM framework. The SSM framework can help me quickly build the web programs I want, including the client and server. At the same time, through learning SSM, I also learned the principles of IOC and AOP. It is very helpful for me to learn other frameworks.

### Introduction

The SSM framework is the abbreviation of Spring + Spring MVC + MyBatis. Spring relies on injecting DI to manage components of each layer, and uses aspect-oriented programming AOP to manage things, logs, permissions, etc. SpringMVC represents Model (model) View (view) Controller (control) receiving external requests, distributing and processing. Mybatis is a framework based on jdbc, which is mainly used to manipulate databases and link business entities with data tables.
